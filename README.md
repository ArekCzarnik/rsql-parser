# RSQL / FIQL parser

RESTful Service Query Language (RSQL) is my language and library that is designed for searching entries in RESTful services. RSQL is based on URI-friendly syntax [FIQL](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-atompub-fiql-00) (Feed Item Query Language) - IETF Internet-Draft of syntax for expressing filters across the entries in a Web feed. FIQL is great for use in URL because it doesn't contain unsafe characters, so URL encoding isn't necessary. On the other side, it's not very intuitive and URL encoding isn't always that big deal, so RSQL provides also more common alternative syntax.

This is complete parser for RSQL written in [JavaCC](http://javacc.java.net/) and Java. Since RSQL is based on [FIQL](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-atompub-fiql-00), it can be used for FIQL as well. RSQL-parser is related with [RSQL-hibernate](https://github.com/jirutka/rsql-hibernate) - library for translating RSQL expression to Hibernate's Criteria query.


## Grammar and semantic

### Expression

Expression is composed of one or more constraints, related to each other with Boolean operators.

    expression = [ "(" ],
                 ( constraint | expression ),
                 [ logical-operator, ( constraint | expression ) ],
                 [ ")" ];

* Logical AND : ";" or " and "
* Logical OR : "," or " or "
					
    logical-operator = ";" | " and " | "," | " or ";

By default, the AND operator takes precedence (i.e., it is evaluated before any OR operators are). However, a parenthesized expression can be used to change precedence, yielding whatever the contained expression yields.


### Constraint

A constraint is composed of a selector, which identifies an entry's element, and a comparison/argument pair, which refines the constraint.

    constraint = selector, comparison-operator, argument;

Comparison operators are:
* Equal to : "==" or "="
* Not equal to : "!="
* Less than : "=lt=" or "<"
* Less than or equal to : "=le=" or "<="
* Greater than operator : "=gt=" or ">"
* Greater than or equal to: "=ge=" or ">="

    comparison-operator = "==" | "=" | "!=" | "=lt=" | "<" | "=le=" | "<=" | "=gt=" | ">" | "=ge=" | ">=";

A selector can be a single Local Name (e.g. course), QName (e.g. my:course) or path (e.g. course/name, my:course/my:name). It may contain a link "dereference" via dot-notation (eg. course/department.code).

    selector   = qname, { ("/" | "."), qname };
    qname      = identifier, [ ":", identifier ];
    identifier = ? ["a"-"z","A"-"Z","_","0"-"9","-"]+ ?

An argument can be of two types. Any character sequence between single or double quotation marks, or unquoted sequence without whitespace, parentheses, comma or semicolon.

    argument    = arg_ws | arg_sq | arg_dq;
    argument-ws = ? ( ~["(", ")", ";", ",", " "] )+ ?;
    argument-sq = ? "'" ~["'"]+ "'" ?;
    argument-dq = ? "\"" ~["\""]+ "\"" ?;


## How to use

RSQL-parser uses Maven2 as its build tool. Java sources for parser itself are generated by _javacc-maven-plugin_ during build process.

If you're using Maven2, simply add these lines to your pom.xml:

    <repositories>
        <repository>
            <id>jirutka.cz</id>
            <name>Repository with RSQL</name>
            <url>http://repos.jirutka.cz/maven/</url>
        </repository>
    </repositories>

    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>cz.jirutka.rsql</groupId>
            <artifactId>rsql-parser</artifactId>
            <version>1.0</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>

Otherwise, download jar file from [here](http://repos.jirutka.cz/maven/cz/jirutka/rsql/rsql-parser/1.0/rsql-parser-1.0.jar). The only dependencies are [slf4j](http://www.slf4j.org/) and [JUnit](http://www.junit.org/).

The main class is `RSQLParser` and its static method `parse(String rsql)`.
